A dataset that provides the name, sales, series, release date, genre, developer, and publisher of PC games sold.

Some questions I would like to think about:

Which series saw the highest sales?
What genre is the highest selling?
What genre is the lowest selling?
What year saw the highest sales of PC games?

When did certain developers and publishers see their highest sales?
