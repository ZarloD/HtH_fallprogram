A dataset that provides the name, sales, series, release date, genre, developer, and publisher of PC games sold.

Some questions I would like to think about:

What is the highest selling game of all time?
What is the all time highest selling series on PC?
What is the all time highest selling genre on PC?
What year saw the highest PC game sales?
What month do PC games sell the most?
Do publishers work with certain developers more than others?
Which developers have the most genre diversity?
When did each genre see the most game releases?
What time of the year do games usually release?
